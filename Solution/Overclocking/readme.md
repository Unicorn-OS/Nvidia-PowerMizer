>@genrix, well, that sucks. I had a feeling that it’s a limitation of the 1080. I suspect hardware and not drivers, because it’s the same in windows … I can overclock P2 to the same clocks as P3, but then as soon as my 3D app closes, the card crashes and takes down the OS with it (this is because you can’t overclock just P2; it automatically increases clocks for the other states too, which go above the limits and then chokes when switching state).

>@bans3i, overclocking works fine in Ubuntu. You need to enable coolbits and have a monitor connected (or trick it to think there is a monitor connected via xorg.com 6). Try a google."
